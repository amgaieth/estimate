Hello I am moving from Victoria to Montreal I have read on this blog of some people talking about some people moving outewest be very weary cost of living is incredibly high your looking at $1,200-$1,500 for a single bedroom out of town. And, rental availability is 1% Good Luck! if you want to buy. I personally have lived here all of my life, and I just can't survive here any longer. I am a person on disability and therefore I will only be making just under a $1,000 I don't speak any French but I am very willing to learn and I am a quick study can anybody give me any information at all as far as best neighborhoods that are close to the metro?

I live in the west island of Montreal and here anglophones don't need French to live a normal life.
<br/>
You know racism has many colours and flavours, I think no one wants to be forced for something different than normal.
<br/>
Some of the extreme remarks about French who are racists might be right but I suspect these affirmations come from other provinces because sometimes it is not realistic.
<br/>
Some other cultures including anglophones don't like French Canadian even if we could be open and friendly but you have to accept it</div>

<br/>
&#34;Hi Friends,
<br/>

<br/>
I am from India...&#34;
<br/>

<br/>
140k is more than enough!
<br/>
anywhere downtown is nice, quartier latin is my favourite.
<br/>
Montreal is a small city really doesnt take to long to get from one end to the other, maybe an hour on the metro.
<br/>

<br/>
Here are the rules as I remember them for immigrants ( i now live in ontario)
<br/>

<br/>
If you are an immigrant and you speak english already you may send your kids to english schools. if you speak neither national official language you must send your kids to french school.
<br/>
My advice if you are planning on putting down roots in Canada ( you will likely find your children will decide this for you . canada is very popular with immigrant kids, they rarely want to go back &#34;home&#34;)
<br/>
Have them learn french. public secondary education is free, take advantage of it. Post secondary is very cheap compared to USA, about par with the average in EU which varies hugely I know.
<br/>
Additionally if your kids are anglophones and CHOOSE to attempt uni in french, tuition is waived!
<br/>
take advantage of that. (that was the rule ten years ago when i was a uni student picking schools, maybe its changed?)
<br/>
also your kids will have poor access to jobs during school if they are not bilingual.
<br/>
really if you are going to live in mtl you should be planning on being bilingual, not immediately, but eventually.</div>

To answer all types of questions
<br/>
I was born, raised and lived in Montréal for the past 25 years. Lots of questions and statements found here could use answers and complementary information.
<br/>
First, French is a huge part of living in Montréal. It is essential. If, as some might have stated, it would be possible for you to find employment speaking English, those jobs will never be quite interesting. The real challenge about not speaking French would definetly be socialisation.
<br/>

<br/>
Québécois are, once again as stated previously, a bit hard to meet: using the social space, we are cold, kept to ourselves, and might seem impossible to attain. However, we are very warm people towards our friends. As the Danes (concept of «Hygge» or Swedes), we are, you can say, very private people, who do not really master the concept of «acquaintance». If it is hard to meet and get to know Québécois, French will definetly help you get easier social experiences. People here litterally wait for the bus a meter from one another to avoid having conversation with strangers. It has nothing to do with where you are from, it has to do with the fact that we don't know eachother.
<br/>

<br/>
Montreal is a very densely populated city. One of the densest cities in the world at 4 518 person/km2. When it comes to defining what is a «central neighbourhood», people do not necessary use the same spatial definition. The rent price compiled for «city centre» is more representative for the «central neighbourhoods» following the east wing of the Orange line, the couple few stations on the Blue line west of Jean-Talon, the «Centre-Ville» (everything cought between both wings of the Orange line), and more and more for the couple stations west of Lionel-Groulx on the Green line. Rent is definetly not going to be the priciest thing on your budget, but Markets and utilities are expensive. My household has two people and a cat: groceries and drugstore items are about 150$ a week (we do not shop at the cheapest place, and cook a lot, with care), and utilities (all Hydro) go from 85$/2months in the summer up to 450$/2months in the winter. We tape up the windows, seal up the doors and take good care of our ecological print. Most appartments are old and isolation can somehow lack, but between -20 in the winter and +35 in the summer, it's quite hard to keep track of the climate.
<br/>

<br/>
Speaking of which: Winter can be cold, yes, but it's not the cold you shall fear, it's the wet. A Canada Goose coat won't get you far. Get a good coat which is impermeable. Lolë make tough ones for women, and Mountain Equipment coop can get the men happy. Sorel or Pajar boots will keep your feet warm, but you do not necessary need this. Wellies will get you on just fine, as between the tube commute, the bus, the indoors/outdoors walking, isolated boots just might get you wet from the inside... And once you're wet, there is no way to escape the cold. Downtown has the most vast underground city (RÉSO) in the world, so if you work there, you might not even need to get out on terrible weather days.
<br/>
Summer is terrible. It's humid, hot, and everyday ends up with a thunderstorm. Montréal has the second most rainfall annually (after the Olympic Bay, i.e. Vancouver-Seattle-Tacoma), you can expect a rainfall every other day, and the precipitations are less frequent in the winter. November is the worst, as there is no sunlight, no snow, and loads of rainfall.
<br/>

<br/>
On finance: Yes, taxes are high, but that's what makes us equal, and we are quite proud to pay taxes. We are nowhere near wanting to get those down. If you do not like the idea of paying taxes, I suggest Alberta. It did not get them much luck, although. Minimum wage is not so high (11$ an hour), but only unqualified workers (usually on manual work, retail, coffee shops, etc) really end up working on minimum wage. This is not to be seen as an example of what your salary could be. Median income as of 2011 was 38 750$/year for one person. Median income is more representative than average income, as the middle class is quite enormous (although shredding)in Québec.
<br/>

<br/>
Hockey is important. Canadiens de Montréal's flag will rise upon the City Hall during playoffs season. About flags: Québécois are quite fond of the Fleurdelysé, and it flies mostly everywhere. It might seem odd for you at first, but you will get to love it. Plus, if you ever have children in Québec, you will get a Fleurdelysé in his/her birthpackage.
<br/>

<br/>
Environment is also quite important. If you throw something on the ground, people will look at you with disgust. And will be right to do so. There is selective collect through the city (for households at home, and in the streets), and starting 2020, you will have to pay (for every Kg) of residual waste at home. Compost is now offered to an important amount of households, and recycling is mandatory.
<br/>

<br/>
Public transportation is quite efficient, and there is a wide offer of carsharing. If you live in central Montréal, Public transportation qui cheap (87$/month), but if you live in the suburbs, it gets pricey quite fast. There is a special price for children and students. Most neighbourhoods do not have a school bus system, children mostly use public transportation to get to school if they go to a chosen school, but «neighbourhood schools system» grants them the right to be a walking distance of school. Parents usually go with them up to 3rd or 4th grade, but by 5th (they are 10 or 11), they often go alone. Children play and walk alone all the time, and it's quite safe.
<br/>

<br/>
I hope I have been able to help you figure out the life in Montréal.
<br/>
I have uploaded the web pages to Immigration Québec and the Charte de la langue Française, those are documents you should seek information in. Please note that Immigration is a shared competency in Québec, so look at the documents you will find there in addition of the documents on Immigration Canada.
<br/>

<br/>
Hope you will love Montréal,
<br/>
J.</div>

My quick two cents as a Montreal native:
<br/>
- French is strongly recommended...It's possible to find some places (smaller companies) that require little French though, but it will limit your job options.
<br/>
- Most people are nice. However, although you WILL run into the racist/anglophobe occasionally...Maybe once every two months (or a handful times a year) you'll run into a public service worker who cannot/won't speak English to you on purpose. It's not often, but over time it can grind your patience, if you let it bother you. Just be ready for it.
<br/>
- Taxes are high. Rents are cheaper than say Toronto and more affordable. Salaries are lower though, and are not increasing enough. I've personally used www.stayhomesearch.com to find a place for myself, they also have an About Montreal section which I found useful...</div>

Nobody should come and live in Montréal if they do not speak french.  Life will be a lot more difficult.  The average rent it is not 600$ unless you live in a 1 bedroom.  The average rent for a family and to live comfortably is at least 1,000$ plus utilities.  With 2,000# a month after taxe you will not live comfortably.  But I guess it is better then some other places.  Yo0u have to pay an average of 33 % taxes on you salary, plus another 15 % when you buy cother thing but food.  Internet and cellular phone are pretty expensive, another average of 59$ each.  School is frre for children under 16 and obligatory, but you still have to spend for books, and accessory. Naturally, yo9u can have social welfare, like a lots a people who just arrive in this city, but not always easy to live on this.  I have been living in Montreal forover50 years, I dospeakfrench, and I had a good job, but in the last years I saw the cost of living going very high and the salary do not follow the cost of living.  So the capacity of buying is getting lower and lower.  The Canadian dollars is not really going well also, at this moment it&lt;s ,71$ for 1 US.  There is also another expens, you have to considered, in winter allthe expens goeas very high.  You nedd clothing for winter and also for summer, at least two sets of clothing.  So yes it is better then a lots of countries, but I am sure yo9u can do better.</div>

Hi Friends,
<br/>

<br/>
I am from India and getting a job offer in Montreal, the offer is for a director level with a yearly package of CAD 140K+. I know that taxes are high and it would eat into the take home. I would also get company provided insurance/health care.
<br/>
My questions are
<br/>
1. If the package is good enough for family of 3 including my wife and daughter..
<br/>
2. Good areas to live, how would be the rents for 2 Bedroom apartment
<br/>
3. Daughters education - She is 4.5 years old and would be going to pre-primary.. does not know French, can she get admission to English school (we do not know french)
<br/>
4. My wife is a IT Consultant with 8+ yrs of experience - would she possibly get any job (does not know french)
<br/>

<br/>
I look forward to your responses and feedback
<br/>

<br/>
Thanks</div>

Lots of comments about non accepted cultures etc from what I read but here is a simple TRUTH. Mtl is an INCREDIBLY affordable city to live in. If you make 20k a year and have a roome-mate (or more) you will not live like a king but you will certainly not live poor. It all depends on your situation I suppose (kids / no kids / significant other etc) but trust me MTL is CHEAP as F. xo</div>

Look people, I don't know why you get so offended here.It is true that the French Montreal society is not easy to breake into. At the same time it is true about France itself...yet people go there for the culture - so what is the problem? Yes settling in Montreal with a family will surely not be so easy especially coming from outside. Yet I definately would not call locals racist. They just are what they are - French Canadians and it is upon you to do the homework before going there. At the same time I will also say that most of the facts in the neggative comments about the weather, the job-market, and the language are true...as are the statements about the greate social scene museums and the city itself</div>

Well, think the comment made by #Jay Abe on Oct 22, 2014 is mostly true, surely there are cases of people who have succeeded in the province but those are exceptional cases. If you have all the qualifications to obtain a good job but you don't speak French, they will say that you need to speak French, then you will learn the language and in time you will master it, then they will say that you need to have studies in any of the local universities, well, you will obtain a degree in McGill, UQAM, UDEM or Concordia and then they will tell you that you need local experience... and I can continue going on listing all the possible excuses they will present to justify the fact that a non Quebecois can't get a job at the level of his/her experience. I have nothing against Quebec, I've been living here for the last 4 years and it is my home now, but the reality is the reality and there's nothing wrong with sharing this knowledge.
<br/>

<br/>
I know many cases of people who speak the French, English + (at least) their mother tongue, with university degrees and years of experience in their fields working for well-known companies around the world and, they have left the province (or accepted a job under their level of experience) due to the lack of opportunities. I heard from 2 HR advisers, both of them born in Montreal, that I should change my name to a Quebec-native one in order to get an interview. I have even more shocking proofs of discrimination in the labor market but I will keep them for myself now.</div>

I am living in Montréal since 1980 and I am very well integrated into the Québec Society.  Jay Abe is very sarcastic in his post from October, 22, 2014.  Abe says that Quebeckers are extremely closed-minded individuals and that you must have a French sounding name if you want to succeed.  My name is definitely German and it has not prevented me from being well accepted into Québec Society. I am from Germany and it is definitely easier to integrate into Québec society than into German society. Values in Québec are different from the rest of Canada. Due to social programs inequity is lower in Québec than elsewhere in Canada. A majority of people in Québec was opposed to the US war in Iraq, while a majority in the rest of Canada supported it. People in Québec support Palestinians much more that elswhere in Canada.  There are very many examples of values that make Québec a distinct society.
<br/>

<br/>
I must say that Abe's comments sound much like comments from an English speaking Canadian from outside Québec who is is bashing Québec.  Québec bashing is quite popular.  If you make efforts to integrate and respect the values of Québec society, you will succeed, but takes more than a few months. In this commment I am writing Québec rather than Quebec.  Québec is the official spelling and Québec's official language is French. If you don't learn French you cannot hope to be happy in Québec. It takes time, but is worth the effort!
<br/>

<br/>
Using the work National appropriately the ultimate test for integration in Québec. The Québec parliament is called National Assembly, because Québec is a distinct society, a nation. I you cannot accept this difference from the rest of Canada, you will not be happy in Québec. The cultural differences go back to the colonization of Québec by people from France. Have a look at the description of the recent documentary Empreinte: http://www.ridm.qc.ca/en/programmation/films/776/empreinte-l
<br/>

<br/>
By the way, people from Latin cultures seem to integrate much more easily than from other cultures...</div>

Joe Abe is 100% correct. There is political movement right now aimed at improving the economy in Montreal. I have lived here for +40 years and it's a love/hate relationship. The taxes are horrendous. The culture is fabulous. Our public transport is signifigantly better than a city like Toronto and more affordable. You must send your children to the French school unless you pay for private education and the Montreal French school board has an abysmal record especially for male children.I am personally making sure my family uses the stupidly inexpensive education costs to get all of us top notch degrees then we will leave. Who knows, maybe they can turn this place around. The bottom line is, come on down but make sure your exit strategy is in place.</div>

There is definitely no perfect city but Montreal, Quebec is an amazing and delightful place to live and raise children. I live in the city and my borough is becoming more and more multicultural and it’s wonderful!  When my children started daycare, there were children that didn’t speak a word of French and now they speak fluently! Is that so bad?  98% of North America speaks English… we are the 2% that speak French. Personally, I have lived in a few countries and speak fluent English and German… the more languages you learn the better. No?
<br/>

<br/>
In addition, all the taxes I pay make it possible for families that arrive with nothing to send their children to subsidized daycare (appro.$7.50/day). I give a big percentage of my salary in order that everyone in Quebec, shape, size or color… live in dignity and happiness. We believe it’s better to share wealth and iron out as much as possible economical differences.
<br/>

<br/>
As for healthcare, when it’s urgent and you need it, it’s FREE and fast.  When it’s not so urgent it can be painfully long. Bring toys and pencils for kids 
<br/>

<br/>
Anyhow, I’m sad to read such bad posts about Montrealers/Quebeckers … but maybe it’s good that some people bitch my city, best kept gem in the world.  Bienvenue à Montréal!</div>

For those who are thinking about moving to Montreal:
<br/>

<br/>
I've been living here for 25 years so I will try to give you a view from my perspective.
<br/>

<br/>
- You will need on average 5k a month (after tax) to support a family. You can get by with 2k by yourself.
<br/>

<br/>
-Rent: Varies, but for a 2BR $500-$1500. More expensive downtown. The apartments here are in bad shape and old. You are obliged to sign a lease for 1 year and provide good references.
<br/>

<br/>
-Groceries: $250-$800 per month. A family of 4 will easily hit $800. Super C and Maxi are usually are the cheapest with Metro, IGA and Loblaws being the most expensive groceries stores.
<br/>

<br/>
-Hydro (which means electricity): $50-$400 per month, depends on whether you heat your home with electricity or is included in the apartment rental. Winter months are very cold and summers extremely hot and humid.
<br/>

<br/>
- Taxes: Very, very high. almost half your annual salary will disappear, adding to this 17% taxes on almost everything you purchase. Quebec is the highest taxed place in North-America. Do not underestimate that statement. The more you make, the more you pay, as simple as that.
<br/>

<br/>
- Job market: Very selective, yes you read that right. It doesn't matter you speak french well or not. It doesn't matter if you have all the diplomas in the world or you won the Nobel price. If your name is not a Quebecker one you will not get a good paying job. If you manage to find a job it will either be something below your actual competencies or not well paid or both. Expect to send many resumes and not get a single answer. If you manage to get an interview they will most of the time say you lack experience (which is another way of telling you that you don't look Quebecker enough). Finding a job here will be very, very frustrating.
<br/>

<br/>
- Transportation: The public transit system is OK. The busses and subways are super loaded at rush hour and there are very frequent interruptions. Like almost every day. Waiting for a bus at -25 degrees celsius only to find out that it's full is extremely frustrating.
<br/>

<br/>
- Roads: Extremely poor shape. There are more potholes than in Baghdad. Bridges are crumbling to the point where they can potentially fall at any given moment. Construction work is everywhere creating very heavy congested traffic at all time of the day. It is not a pleasant experience to drive in the streets of Montreal. Tight, congested streets (especially in winter with the snow on the sides). Traffic lights are at every corner and not synched, creating lots of frustration, traffic and wasting your gas. People drive bikes in the middle of the street not caring so you're in constant fear of hitting one. Police cars are everywhere hiding just ready to give you a ticket for any reason like a U turn in the middle of the night.
<br/>

<br/>
- Healthcare: Very slow and bloated. Expect long waits at the emergencies, like 12 hours. If you want better and faster service you have to go to a private clinic and pay. You can forget about family doctors. The good doctors leave this province for a better life and pay elsewhere.
<br/>

<br/>
- Schooling: French is mandatory for all kids. College and universities can be attended at the language of choice. Education here is very good and cheaper than anywhere else.
<br/>

<br/>
- Weather: Not pleasant unless you enjoy winter. Extreme temperatures ranging from -30 Celsius in winter to +35 in summer. The weather is so unpredictable that not even the weather station can get it right. People discuss the weather everyday that's how bizarre it is.
<br/>

<br/>
- Social life / entertainment: From all the negative aspects of this city, this is the only one that stands out as positive. There are so many restaurants and ethnic food to chose from. There's many festivals and concerts for free during summer and winter time. The clubbing scene is amazing. There's lots of attractions and museums for all ages. If you enjoy nature, an hour drive will usually get you to the country side where you can hike mountains, camp, fish or hunt. If you like hockey you will love this place.
<br/>

<br/>
As a final word of advice, if you come from a foreign land you have a way better chance in Ontario. Quebeckers are extremely closed-minded individuals. Their colonial history has shaped their society into a closed protectionist of their own identity and values. If you remotely sound or look or think different than them then you will never fit in here. Even if you speak perfect french, their french is not the same and you will have a hard time understanding their slangs. Many people in recent years have picked-up and left for either Alberta or Ontario because the job market there is much stronger and growing. Businesses in Quebec have also moved because of the government's stubborn stance on the french language, heavy bureaucracy and high taxes. Also, Quebec has the highest level of corruption in Canada. The mafia is deeply rooted in the Montreal municipal government which costs the city a lot of taxes so they can allocate construction contracts to their mafia friends. Montreal is good only for students, not to raise a family.</div>

I am intending to move all alone to Montreal in the near future... I do live in the middle east right now.

Can u assist me in the monthly cost of living.. How much do i need to spend each month for living ( housing, food, transportation,etc...).
<br/>
Is it easy to find a job? Noting that i work in logistics field and i have an experience of 4 years. I am good in french and english.
<br/>
Do u think i will have to attend any special courses related to my profession (logistics) to be able to find a job easily? Noting that i got my masters degree in management from UQAC.

Are there any organizations that can assist me to settle safely since i'm going to Canada all alone? Can these organizations ensure me housing/residence and other services as soon as i land in Montreal? f yes, at what cost?

Hi Vanz,
<br/>

<br/>
first thing i need to tell you is , the immigrant agents do not have any power to make your application accepted. in my opinion you can do it in your own.
<br/>

<br/>
As your husband is the principle applicant, the age could be against your selection, the second one against you is knowledge of french.
<br/>

<br/>
The immigration department will not send you any letter to learn french , instead they may send you a rejection letter and ask you to file more documents or information if you have any (which can be french knowledge)
<br/>

<br/>
As far as I know your file is a difficult one (sorry to say this)</div>

Hi Wassim,

sorry i replied with a wrong answer in my earlier reply.
<br/>

<br/>
For you to get into montreal, please be sure that you are at intermediate level in french and you are a certified nursing professional, you will be given a training once you get a job in one of the hospitals here .
<br/>

<br/>
The initial selection process is a bit tough if you do not have french knowledge, hope you verified your points on the skilled worker category.
<br/>

<br/>
once you get the selection it will take only 6 months for you to get into canada.
<br/>

<br/>
for all in this thread , my advice is &#34;IF YOU WANT TO COME TO QUEBEC, YOU NEED TO BE AN INTERMEDIATE LEVEL IN FRENCH&#34;
<br/>

<br/>
the immigration office has some good officers who wants to select all the applicants, some will always find a reason to reject you.</div>

For you to start in montreal, 6000$ is sufficient for 3 months even you can drag upto 4 months with this amount. The rentals are cheaper here.

 Do not worry about your job until you are good in french, if your search is on target, your will get a job in 8 weeks(2 weeks for initial formalities for new immigrants)</div>

As you are from Nepal, your application will be processed in Delhi or Hongkong, you can see from the following link the current processing times
<br/>
http://www.immigration-quebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/immigrate-settle/permanent-workers/official-immigration-application/processing-times-table.html
<br/>

<br/>
In this link they might have listed cut off date of application i.e. if they say jan 2013 that means they processed upto that month.
<br/>

<br/>
The normal time taken for QSC is 18-24 months in your region.
<br/>

<br/>
if you do not have enough points then they might inform you within six months to send any docuements that could help you to get more point, but if you have the points they will send you an interview invitation.
<br/>

<br/>
if you had not received any information from them for 12 months then your points should be ok and they will soon confirm about the interview soon. please improve your french knowledge before the interview which is an elimination criteria.

all the best</div>

If you are applying for Quebec , you need to submit your application to immigration bureau in Hongkong , but remember if you are not an intermediate level in French then quebec is not an option for you. For more information please go to http://www.immigration-quebec.gouv.qc.ca/EN/immigrate-settle/permanent-workers/index.html

the second option is applying for federal migration in which you can migrate to any province in Canada except quebec. go to http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/index.asp for more information.</div>

<br/>
please do write with a name next time , it will be easier to answer.
<br/>

<br/>
if you are successful in DELF , it is a big advantage for you.
<br/>

<br/>
Coming to the cost of living , $25000 a year is more than enough for two people if you share accommodation. I would say, Rent 600-700(including heating) transportation 80+80(public transport) if you cook yourself , it will not be more than 200$/month/person. 1500$/month is sufficient for both of you in the first year.
<br/>

<br/>
About location in Montreal, you need to find an apartment near a metro station which will save you money and time. I would suggest the following places for you to look for an apartment  Lasalle /ville-emard or Côte-Des-Neiges , if you are ready to opt for a congested place then park extension is a good place to have cheaper apartments.

Hi Sunny,
<br/>

<br/>
I think the answers I gave to Sheila could help you in a way to get some information about the cost of living and the job opportunity in your field.
<br/>

<br/>
As you are coming with two kids, you may not have much of a problem for your initial finances. You may get more child benefit amount for the second child.
<br/>

<br/>
bottom line is you need to learn French before you come here(at least to an intermediate level), although you can enroll in an advanced French course here.</div>

Hi Sheila,

<br/>
this is the link for French courses http://www.immigration-quebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/french-language/index.html.
<br/>

<br/>
when it comes to child benefits ,You will be meeting with a Quebec immigration office at the airport , the officer will give you an appointment with Quebec immigration counselor at a later date, During this counseling they will provide you with the forms required for child benefits.
<br/>

<br/>
As far as the French course is concerned, you can apply through the site I mentioned above. you may need to mention a reference number from your Quebec selection certificate. There will be a question in your application on whether you need financial assistance.</div>

Regarding the french course, does it mean while we are in the course we will receive $460 each? How long does the course take?

Hi Sheila,
<br/>

<br/>
When you select a place in Montreal, it should be close to the metro (walkable distance), I would suggest Lasalle /vill-emard or Côte-Des-Neiges area you can find a cheaper apartment which includes you heating cost and they will provide the refrigerator and the stove. you may need to buy the other furniture (may be cheaper second hand ones) the initial cost for buying things will be around 600$(TV , bed, sofa, dining etc.). your monthly expense (rent $550 1 bed room/kitchen/living we call it 3 and 1/2) could be at around 1500 to 1750 a month initially. In the mean time you will start receiving child tax benefits and child assistance (could be around 200-300$ a month) this will help you to spend for your child.
<br/>

<br/>
if you enroll to a French class you will get a stipend of 115$ a week this will account to $460 a month, if your spouse too take the course you may get $920 if you put all these amounts together you will get around $1200-1300 a month which is sufficient for you until you find a job. so the life will not be that difficult if you come over here with $6000.
<br/>

<br/>
let me know if you have any more questions.</div>

Anyway, I think you're right, acceptance and embracing the whole country will make it easier like we've been knowledgable that Montreal is a bilingual country and knowing French is a necessity. So we might as well learn and study the language.
<br/>
In addition, would you be able to suggest please on where is the best place to settle in montreal? For a starter like us, cheap but of course safe is a must. Lets say it will take us 2-3 mos without work, could Cad  $6000 enough to survive?
<br/>
Thank you!</div>

Hi Sheila,
<br/>

<br/>
As you are a Nurse, you have a great opportunity in Montreal. Once you land here , I recommend you to learn the French language. There is a super hospital which will be opened this year(2014) they need a lots of doctors and nurses, nowadays Quebec allows doctors from other countries to register here.
<br/>

<br/>
if you take a decision to move to Montreal, it is good one at the same time you may need really work hard for the first two years to stabilize your family on all the aspects, who knows you can be an owner of a house at the end to two years.
<br/>

<br/>
all the best</div>

Montreal is a good place for immigrants, it is a choice you need to make between the cities where the life is fast(Toronto, Vancouver, Ottawa etc.) and a relatively slower lifestyle (Montreal). My advice for the immigrants is, if there is a will there is a way , you need to accept the language(learn French immediately you land here, this will make a big difference),you can help your kids in their studies if you spend 6 months in a French course.
<br/>

<br/>
If you are looking only for money or if you compare the earnings here with other cities then I would say you are making a mistake. The initial stay here will be struggle for everyone but the situation may change quickly if you try hard for jobs.
<br/>

<br/>
Job hunt: some immigrants come to Montreal with a higher expectation on salaries and when they get a job or apply for a job , they compare the salaries outside Montreal(which is always higher) and they start to make excuses that &#34;it is hard to get a job without French&#34; , I would say if there are 1000 jobs in the market now, 30-40% of those jobs may accept a candidate who speaks only French. if you are looking for a blue collar job then 90% of the jobs does not look for the language. for the white collar jobs you need make the right hit (apply for all the jobs even if they ask for French) if the job advertisement says &#34;bilingualism&#34; that is an indication that if you know English you will be considered. The strategy you  need to adopt is to compromise on your salary to have a full time permanent job (this is more important to be successful in Montreal) . Even if you have lesser salary , you can have your expenses within that.</div>

Hi,
<br/>
I would like to ask for help to decide if it is a good idea to move and live in Montreal. We are currently living in Auckland, New Zealand and the cost of living here is a way too high. I have read that it was 28% lower there in Montreal. I have read the comments above and some gave me a fright really. We are applying as immigrant so we will find a job as we get there. Is it easy to look for a job? We are both nurses but has not yet registered in Canada. We have a 7 yrs old son. Shall we stay here in Nee Zealand? Help. Thanks :)</div>

Montreal is great. Especially if you're an Artist or someone living 'outside of the sqaure'. Abundance of wonderful bars, restaurants, cafes, bookstores, fashion stores, cinemas. Lot's of great independant grocery stores and to be honest the cost of living ain't too bad when you factor in the rent is anywhere from 1/4 to 2/3rd's of what you would pay in another city. I don't speak french and I get by just fine, although if i did spend 2-3 months taking lessons the jobs I would be able to work would increase dramatically.
<br/>

<br/>
Also, people tend to be happy here, and it's one of the few places i've lived/been that engenders a real sense of community in certain neighbourhoods.
<br/>

<br/>
The city itself is beautiful, downtown is one of the least gross downtowns i've encountered, the mountain is fantastically beautiful, a real gift to the people of this city. 10 Minutes of walking and you're in complete wilderness.</div>

Stay away from Montreal. The idea that Montreal`s cost of living is acceptable is wrong. You pay less to live to rent, but you`re paid less at work as well. Services here are really awful, people are rude, a large quantity of quebecois are dirty, smelly, rude and taking full advantage of welfare blaming immigrants for their wrong doing, but it seems to me that there are more immigrants working than locals. Housing here is also very bad when considering the way houses were built and how they are maintained. Most apartments are falling apart, pest infested, you have horrible landlords, windows that don`t open, lack of safety, noisy neighbours and so on and so forth.
<br/>
Driving here is horrible. Statistics Canada puts Montreal as the second place with most accidents in Canada, right after GTA, but WAY smaller than GTA, so in the end, it counts for more.
<br/>
Health care is really bad... Unless you go to the hospital unable to breathe, count on waiting between 8 and 24 hours for EMERGENCY!
<br/>
All public service is in French and although the rule is that they should be bilingual, they aren`t and resent answering in English.
<br/>
The separatists are as strong as ever. Canada would do WAY BETTER by cutting it`s losses and letting go of this province that sucks all the milk that the rest of the country works hard to provide. I come from Ontario and can`t wait to go back home.
<br/>
Montreal has the HIGHEST number of cases of domestic violence in the country. Yet, the justice system is completely unfazed about it and deals with it as a slap on the hand kind of problem. One MD here killed his 2 children. Less than 3 years later he is free and working again. This province is going to the dogs.
<br/>
There`s no work, no security, no honesty, no justice and if you take the bus or subway to go anyway you will also notice that they have no soap.</div>

Just to answer a few questions I saw here... I've been living in Montreal for 7 years now. kind of getting motivated to move to BC. As a separatist gvnt is in power, aggressive and excluding laws have been put in place. Eg.
<br/>

<br/>
French: It is mandatory that all companies demand their employees to speak french at work so you do need french to find a decent job and to get along with la societe quebecois.
<br/>

<br/>
Schools: You cannot register your child in an English school even if it's private. Only if you were educated in english and you have prove of it. Children are forced into the French School system by the means of welcoming schooling which is French and Math (In french) the years that are necessary until your child gets the level to adapt to the regular system, totally isolated from the rest of the school. School drop-outs in Quebec exceeds 25%
<br/>

<br/>
Taxes: Almost everything here is taxed. from purchases expect almost a 17% rate as instead of adding federal and provincial taxes, here, you are charged the federal 5% of an amount then charged provincial tax to the subtotal (9.5%), besides your income tax that goes from 30-35% up to more than 50% depending on where your household income stands. So if you think that rent is cheaper than other Canadian cities, Remember the taxes you are paying by the second.
<br/>

<br/>
Health: Expect the longest waiting times in Canada and poor health facilities. NO FAMILY DOCTORS AVAILABLE.
<br/>
If you are a doctor and want to work in Quebec, expect almost impossible acceptance and low wages compared to other regions of North-america and of course you DO NEED to speak french.
<br/>

<br/>
Transportation: Decent availability through the whole city for CAD$3.00. Make sure you have exact change or get the passes. A woman got a CAD$200 ticket for boarding a bus with a 5 dollar bill with her 2 year old kid last week. No AC on buses during summer.
<br/>

<br/>
Traffic: Try to avoid at all costs HWY 15 &amp; HWY 40 mess. Greater Montreal Area is almost 4 million people and the road infrastructure might've been made for 1 million. Total collapse during rush hour without mentioning falling bridges and countless potholes all year round. The whole road system of the province is decadent as corruption drags and eats all your well-earned pennies.
<br/>
Gas prices are 15 cents more expensive in Montreal than in the surroundings.
<br/>

<br/>
Culture: Montreal is a fun city. Lots of activities all year round.
<br/>

<br/>
If you are muslim, or from any other culture or religion and you wear any distinctive item, A new ridiculous law is in place that bans you from wearing it in any gvnt building or place. Being the Quebec Gvnt, the mayor employer in the province it is obvious that you are automatically excluded from being part of them.

Notice hat these numbers depend a lot on lifestyle of the person. My wife and i live with our two kids (1 and 3 years old) in Verdun which is a cheap place, well located, only 7 minutes from downtown and we spend $750 on rent (we're $50 under average as the city is slowly becoming expensive) and $400 in groceries. We pay average $90 for electricity ($40 in summer, up to $150 in winter). School is free unless you want a private one which will cost from $200 to ... anything you want. School is in french, mandatory, unless your parent went to english school (anywhere in the world) hence you have the right to go to an english school too.
<br/>

<br/>
I have a used car (lincoln navigator) which eats a lot of gas, travel yearly to my home country, travel a lot to NY, eat outside 2/3 times a month, have high speed internet  (15/10 mbps) and cell phone (no tv, i use internet). Our average  expenses are $1700 monthly and we can't say that we miss something.
<br/>

<br/>
Notice that Montreal es always less expensive than any other city in canada but the taxes are higher than anywhere else and also the salaries are lower. But USA, i mean plattsburgh or burlington which are 1-2 hours from here is always cheaper than here and you can buy groceries there (no duties as groceries pay no tax)
<br/>

<br/>
Btw, we never pay taxes we always get a refund around $2k or $3k. So make your calculations, hope this helps somebody.</div>

You never become citizen of Quebec because it is not a country but a province of Canada.  You are a resident of Quebec once you arrive and settle in Quebec.  It is true that speaking French (and specially English) helps you find a better job here.  Low to mid-pay jobs do not always require you to speak French but high paying jobs always require that you speak English.  English is the International language but remember that French is the majority language in Quebec.  Furthermore, one of Montreal assets is that it is multicultural.  Most of immigrants speak French, English and their mother tong. Most of people raised in in Montreal speak both French and English.  If you want to experience more of the French Canadian culture and are willing to learn French, Quebec city and other smaller cities might be better choices but it will be harder to get by in English and therefore harder to find a good job (if you do not speak French).
<br/>
Cost of living in Montreal is very similar to most of other North-American cities but real estate cost is lower than let's say Toronto, Vancouver or New York.  An advantage of large cities like Montreal is that most people can get around without a car. You could live in a suburb or outside of Montreal at a lower cost than Montreal but might find it difficult to get around without owning a car.  Some people could live in Montreal for $2000.00 per month and others could not live here for $5000.00 a month because it is mostly a matter of the lifestyle you want.  Monthly grocery cost around $800.00 and  $800.00 or more for a small 1 bedroom apartment,  for 2 people.  Other costs are similar to other N.A. cities.</div>

It is crucial that your child learns French before starting school in Quebec.  The language laws in Quebec are very strict.  Even if English is a child's only spoken language, they must be taught in French (below college level) unless their parents specifically studied in English in Quebec when they were children.  That means that anyone that moves from outside Quebec must enroll their children in a school that is taught only in French.</div>

Eli,
<br/>
Here are some of the best neighborhoods in my opinion:
<br/>
Outremont: very nice, a little expensive.
<br/>
Rosemont: very nice, safe, not very expensive, very &#34;Montreal&#34; (architechture, etc.),
<br/>
Downtown (say, from McGill metro station to Guy-Concordia) nice, but quite expensive, pretty busy, but everything nearby.
<br/>
MileEnd is also nice, becoming more expensive.
<br/>
Open up a Metro map on Google and let's look at some areas by the surrounding metro stations.
<br/>
GREEN LINE: From Honoré-Beaugrand to Frontenac: Mehh.. It's ok, cheap, but not really nice. Metro Frontenac, Préfontaine, Joliette are kind of ghetto (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve is a neighborhood you might want to avoid - not necessarily dangerous, but it just isnt nice; and a little scary at night) Papineau and Beaudry are downtown, in the Gay neighborhood. Berri Uqam is near a university, it's nice (especially St.Denis street, busy, lots of cafés, restaurants etc) but can be expensive. From St-Laurent station to Guy-Concordia, you're downtown. As I said, it's nice, but very busy. And pretty expensive. Atwater is good. Lionel Groulx to Angrignon... It's alright, I guess, not expensive, but nothing there, mostly families.
<br/>
ORANGE LINE: Montmorency to Jarry: NO. It's far, it's not beautiful, not fun, just no.^.^ Jean-Talon to Sherbrooke: YES! Laurier to Sherbrooke are a little more expensive, but great area, great neighborhood, great place. Champs-de-Mars to Bonaventure is the old Montreal. It's very nice, (Bonaventure is more business-y), but also more expensive (great lofts and condos). Great neigborhood though. Lucien L'Allier to Cote-Vertu... I wouldn't live there just because it's far, boring, again, more families, not the same artsy feeling there is downtown. But definitly cheaper for rent. Cote Vertu is very english.
<br/>
BLUE LINE: From St-Michel to Fabre i would avoid. It's also ghetto-ish, again, a little scary at night if you ask me. Just not a good neigborhood. But also definitly cheaper. Jean-Talon to Acadie is also ok, but not great. Not cheap nor expensive. Not that many things to do (except Jean-Talon). Outremont to Université de Montreal is the Outremont neighborhood I was talking about earlier, love this area. Cote des Neiges to Snowdon, not great but not aweful. And finally the
<br/>
YELLOW LINE: Berri-Uqam- same as I said earlier, and Longueuil-Université-de-Sherbrooke, I don't know why you would want to live there, it's just as expensive as Montreal, it's far, and the metro is more expensive :). Hope I helped you a little bit! :D</div>
